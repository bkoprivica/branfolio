Hello!
======

![Illustration of a smiling man](lib/img/avatar.png)

I'm Bran Kop, an Enterprise Cloud Engineer living in Toronto. I’ve spent the better part of 25 years designing and deploying mission‐critical AWS, Azure, on‐premises, and hybrid solutions—leveraging Kubernetes, serverless technologies, and GitOps-driven CI/CD to deliver robust, secure infrastructures.

I've been fortunate to work with a number of bright, creative, and kind humans. Together, we've:

*   Launched SAS Viya on AWS EKS, supporting 1,000+ data scientists and cutting cloud spending by over $1M a year.
*   Built CI/CD pipelines, slashing manual deployment steps by 70%.
*   Established Ministry of Health's ["frictionless multi‐factor authentication for large‐scale analytics platform, safeguarding 1,000+ users."](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ministry-health)
*   Evolved [Context Cloud](http://www.contexts.cloud/)'s multi‐tenant Robotic Context Automation platform, orchestrating microservices across AWS with Kubernetes.
*   Re‐imagined [healthcare data delivery](https://accessonehealth.ca/) by bridging HL7 FHIR with modern cloud solutions for thousands of clinicians.

I work to develop meaningful products, hone my craft, and bring out the best in those around me. [Let's talk](contact/index.htm)!
